"""No rendered stanza may carry a comment welded into a directive value.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH
-------------------------------
Rendered under Ansible's settings (trim_blocks=True), the `search =` line in
savedsearches.conf.j2 ended in `{% endif %}`, whose trailing newline Ansible
strips. The `#` comment block on the following line was therefore appended to
the search value, producing:

    ... | where minutes_silent > 30# Lookback derives from this detector's ...

Splunk stored that happily. It scheduled the search, dispatched it every 10
minutes, and failed it every time with a FATAL parse error. 17 detectors were
live in exactly that state while the test suite stayed green.

WHY THE EXISTING TESTS MISSED IT, TWICE OVER
--------------------------------------------
1. They built bare `jinja2.Environment(...)`, which defaults trim_blocks=False.
   The weld does not occur under that setting, so the rendered text under test
   was not the text Ansible ships. Fixed by `_render_env.ansible_env`.
2. The earlier weld guard (added after a comment swallowed a whole search)
   checked two specific symptoms: a stanza with NO `search` key, and a key
   whose value had absorbed another `key = value` pair. This defect is neither
   — the `search` key is present, non-empty, and absorbed a comment rather than
   a directive. Guarding two known symptoms is not guarding the class.

So this test asserts the general property instead: SPL has no `#` comment
syntax, therefore a `#` inside a rendered `search` value is always a .conf
comment that lost its newline.

FALSIFIABILITY
--------------
A test that cannot fail proves nothing, and this suite has already shipped one
that could not. `check_welded` is therefore run against a fixture that MUST be
flagged and one that must NOT be, before it is run against the real template.
