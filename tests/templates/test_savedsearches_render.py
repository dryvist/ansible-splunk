"""
Guard against a stanza rendering with no `search` at all.

This is not hypothetical. A Jinja comment written with whitespace control on
both sides (`{#- ... -#}`) strips the newline BEFORE and AFTER itself. Placed
between two keys it welds them together, so:

    description = ...missing row.
    {#- explanatory comment -#}
    search = | makeresults ...

rendered as a single `description = ...missing row.search = | makeresults ...`
line. Splunk accepted the file, the stanza appeared in savedsearches.conf, the
report was dispatchable, and `| savedsearch llm_surface_freshness` returned
HTTP 200 with ZERO ROWS. Nothing errored anywhere: not the render, not the
converge, not the search. It reached the live instance and was only caught by
reading the deployed value back.

That is why this test asserts on the RENDERED text rather than the template
source, and why it checks for a missing key rather than for the specific
comment syntax — the next instance of this will be some other construct that
eats a newline, and a check pinned to `{#- -#}` would miss it.

Every check below is exercised against a fixture that must FAIL it, because a
check that cannot fail is indistinguishable from one that passes.
