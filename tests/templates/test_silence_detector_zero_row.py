Guard the tstats/stats zero-row blind spot in savedsearches.conf.j2.

tstats is a GENERATING command: over a lookback window with no matching
events at all, it returns ZERO result rows -- not one row with a null
last_seen -- whether or not it groups `by host`. `stats ... by <field>`
shares the same blind spot when grouped: zero input rows means zero groups,
so it also emits nothing. (An UNGROUPED `stats` aggregate like `stats count`
is exempt -- it always emits exactly one row, even over zero input rows.)
Verified live: index=llm from the router hosts and llm_pipeline emitters was
fully empty for 18 days, and both llm_router_silence_detector (which already
had coalesce(last_seen, 0)) and llm_pipeline_silence_detector never fired.
coalesce() cannot help because there is no row for eval to run it on -- the
downstream `eval minutes_silent = ... | where minutes_silent > N` guard
simply never executes.

The fix is the appendpipe sentinel-row pattern: `appendpipe [ stats count as
_rows | where _rows == 0 | eval last_seen = 0 | fields - _rows ]`. An
ungrouped `stats count` always emits exactly one result row, even over zero
input rows -- so this branch fires precisely when (and only when) the main
result set is empty, synthesizing the missing "everything is silent" row.

Coverage note: this test used to check a hardcoded list of stanza names (the
three named detectors plus the generic per-index loop's non-by_host branch),
so a new stanza with the same defect -- or the loop's by_host branch -- would
not be caught. It now DERIVES the set of checked searches from the rendered
template (see `silence_stanzas()`), the same approach test_cutover_gate.py
uses for the disabled-by-default gate.

Inclusion rule: a stanza qualifies as a silence/staleness detector -- and
therefore must survive its own aggregation returning zero rows -- when its
search performs a grouped aggregation (`tstats`, by-clause or not; or
`stats ... by`) AND computes elapsed time since a last-seen event
(`now() - coalesce(...)`). The second half excludes a spike/content-match
search (nothing to fire on when healthy is correct) and a *data-value*
threshold over a grouped aggregate, e.g. llm_serving_memory_headroom's
`stats avg(...) by host | where ... > 85` -- zero rows there means no host is
over the memory ceiling, the correct silent-when-healthy behavior, not a
blind spot.

index_gap_detector's exempt-index boolean gate is a separate blind spot with
its own regression: see test_index_gap_exempt.py (split out at the per-file
token-budget gate; shares this file's simulator, ./_zero_row_simulator.py).
